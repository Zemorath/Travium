# Phase 4 Project

## Project Purpose

- Create a website for a company that helps manage the needs for people who need it

## Introduction

The internet is becoming increasingly more complex and difficult to use, especially for those who don't interact with it on a daily basis. 
And not just the internet, but everything that uses the internet is more difficult to navigate. Time and time again, we hear stories of
elderly people being taken advantage of either over the phone or the internet by people attempting to scam them. Another issue they face is that
it is just sometimes difficult for them to perform daily tasks such as getting groceries, renewing internet and/or cable promos, cellphone assistance, etc. 
A great solution for this is to create a central place for people to go to view their accounts, schedule grocery deliveries, and other things.

## The Website

The landing page introduces you to a log in form where you can either log in or click to navigate to a sign up site. Once logged in, the user is navigated
to the home page with Travium's logo. From here, there are a couple of different navigational options on the navigation bar, one of them being the services page.
Here, the user can see all of the services they currently have added and can click to add any new ones if they so wish. If the user chooses to add a new service, they 
are met with a form. Here, they can select the type of service they want to add, the company they want that service from, the typical price for their service, etc. 
The next tab over, the user can see all of their user information.

## Future Plans

Some future plans include:

- Add the option to change user information
- Add separate log in for employees
- Employees can add available services that the user can select from
- Add more information to the home page
